C.	Translation

When the Greeks could not capture Troy for ten years, then Epeus made a surprisingly large wooden horse. 
In this horse Menelaus, Ulixes, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus were gathered. 
And on the horse they wrote, “Greeks give a gift to Minervae” and moved theirs camps to island Tenedo. When the Trojans saw it, they judged the enemy had gone away. 
Priamus ordered the horse to be led into the temple of Minervae. The prophet Cassandra said the horse had enemies within, trust was not given to her, they put the the horse in the temple. 
The Greeks exited, killed the guards of the gates and conquered Troy.
