C.	Translation

With Achivi he could not capture Troy in ten years, so Epeus made a surprisingly large wooden horse. 
For this those gathered are Menelaus, Ulixes, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus. 
And on the horse they wrote, “Minerva give the Greeks a gift” translated at camp. When the Trojans saw it, they judged the enemy had gone away. 
Priamus ordered the horse to be led into the temple of Minervae. The prophet Cassandra said the horse has enemies within, have faith in her abilites, the horse should not be put in temple. 
The Greeks exited through the door, killed the guards and conquered Troy.
