Erectheus, son of Pandion, had four daughters. At the time, Eumolpus, son of Neptune, came to attack Athens but was killed. Neptune, angry because his son was killed, said "the daughter of Erechtheus must be sacrificed." Thus, Chtonia, one of the daughters was sacrificed. The other daughters killed themselves. Erectheus was struck by lightning.
